# portofolio
This isn’t just a website — it’s a statement. I’m not the kind of person who says “Hey, I’m Harsh. Hire me.” I’d rather let the work speak first. This portfolio is me — my skills, my visuals, my energy — all packed into a browser tab. If it connects with you, maybe we build something together.
